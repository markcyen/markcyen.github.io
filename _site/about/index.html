  <h2 id="my-name-is-mark-yen">My name is Mark Yen.</h2>
<p>This is my initial stab at starting my own website using GitHub IO and Jekyll. It is currently basic, but I hope to build upon it as I continue to learn about website design and software development.</p>

<h2 id="my-background">My background.</h2>
<p>My parents are immigrants to the United States. I was born and raised in Southern California. I initially went to college at Southern Methodist University but transferred to Washington University in Saint Louis, where I finished my Bachelors degree in Psychology. At that time, I was influenced by television shows, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files">The X-Files</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Smart">Get Smart</a>, so I was lucky enough to get hired as an analyst for the U.S. Department of Defense. After many years of working as a bureaucrat, I made a switch and pursued an M.B.A. at the University of Southern California, focusing on finance. I worked in finance for companies such as Dell Technologies, Ball Corporation, and Charles Schwab. After many years working in corporate finance and financial planning and analysis roles, I recently pursued software development, starting with learning Ruby on Rails. I enjoy building software applications.</p>

<p>This is my story, and I am sticking with it.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology.</h2>

<p>Current tech stack is: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Git, JSON, Heroku, Travis CI</p>

<p>Currently learning: Javascript and Python</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact.</h2>

<p>Whatâ€™s your story? I would love to connect.</p>
