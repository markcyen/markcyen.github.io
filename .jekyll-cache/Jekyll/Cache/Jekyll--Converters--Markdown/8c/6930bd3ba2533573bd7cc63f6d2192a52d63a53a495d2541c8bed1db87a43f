I"Ç<p><em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novelâ€™s supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyllâ€™s loyal butler.</p>

<hr />

<p>Poole is the butler for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator. Itâ€™s designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a> to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.</p>

<p>This demo site was last updated January 18, 2022.</p>

<p>There are currently two themes built on Poole:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">Lanyon</a></li>
</ul>
